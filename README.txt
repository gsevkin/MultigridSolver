INSTRUCTIONS
1. In the terminal, navigate to the parent directory
2. Type 'make mgsolve' to generate the executable program
3. Type './mgsolve <l> <n>' to input the number of levels l and the number of v-cycles n to be executed.
4. The time elapsed, L2 norm of residual after each v-cycle as well as the error for different grid size can be seen in the terminal. A file 'solution.txt' should be generated in which the data layout is compatible with gnuplot.
5. Type 'make clean' to remove all temporary files.
